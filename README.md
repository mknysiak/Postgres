# Introduction
This project analyzes the 2023 job market using datasets collected from job listing aggregators. The data covers a wide range of programming-related roles, but this analysis focuses specifically on data analyst positions. The goal is to identify top-paying roles, the most in-demand skills, and the intersection of high demand with high salaries, while also serving as a practical exercise in learning and applying SQL for real-world data analysis.

The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

SQL code to check answers on above queries: [project.sql file]()  

# Background


# Tools used
In exploring the data analyst job market, I relied on a set of essential tools:

SQL – the core language of the analysis, used to query datasets and extract meaningful patterns.

PostgreSQL – the database system selected to efficiently store and manage the job postings data.

Visual Studio Code – the primary environment for writing and running SQL queries, as well as managing the database.

Git & GitHub – indispensable for version control, documentation, and publishing the SQL scripts and results, enabling both transparency and collaboration.
